# Princess-Sacrifice
The translation of Princess Sacrifice

With about half of the game translated this could be the final stretch 

For now you can pick a file and start translating. Check projects to see what is available.

All dialog is preceded by "EventArg Type="CharString" ExtraData="50">"

ctrl-f is your friend

Regarding line lengths and spacing:

Lines should be max. 60 characters long at most. If needed, up to 65 characters is all right.

If a piece of text is a quote (begins with a quotation mark) or a character thinking to themselves (begins with a parenthesis), then every line except for the first should begin with a long space, which is the (invisible) character between the following quotation marks: “　”. Feel free to copy and paste. Note that this is not the same character as the space you get when pressing your space bar.
